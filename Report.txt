1. Introduction
The SIAM+ Dashboard began as a simple idea:
a lightweight, student-friendly timetable and course viewer that works reliably on any device, loads instantly, and requires zero backend complexity.

What started out as a plain HTML page evolved over multiple iterations into a polished, modern, responsive UI with:

dynamic schedule rendering

light/dark theme system

weekly view with day-pills

course search

progress visualization

fallback embedded data

and even an inline mini-runner game integrated into the timetable card

This document chronicles that evolution while also serving as a proper technical reference for anyone reviewing, grading, or potentially funding this project.

2. Project Goals
The objectives of SIAM+ are threefold:

Usability — a dashboard that students can open quickly during a busy day.

Clarity — simple structure, readable visual hierarchy, zero clutter.

Reliability — data should load even when network conditions are bad.

The system avoids unnecessary frameworks and complexity; everything runs on vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with clean modularity and a predictable file structure.

3. Architecture Overview
Final project structure:

/index.html        → main UI container
/style.css         → light/dark theme tokens, layout, palette
/app.js            → dynamic fetch + rendering logic
/schedule-data.js  → embedded JSON fallback
/schedule.json     → main schedule data (same-origin)
Core Principles
Static-only design: runs on GitHub Pages or any static server.

Dynamic rendering: schedule.json is parsed client-side.

Graceful fallback: if fetch fails, the dashboard auto-loads embedded data.

Persistent theme: user preference saved in localStorage.

Designed mobile-first: layout scales up from small screens.

4. Evolution of Features (Commit-Driven Narrative)
Phase 1 — Base UI & Data Rendering
The earliest version implemented:

single-page structure

hero header

today’s classes

weekly timetable grid

course list with search

progress placeholder

theme toggle

schedule.json fetch

This phase prioritized functionality and made sure the system could display all core student data.

Phase 2 — Dark UI Stabilization & Data Fallback
As the project matured, reliability became a priority:

Dark mode became the default, but still toggleable.

Weekly timetable moved to day-pill interactions instead of a rigid grid.

Empty states were added (“no classes today”).

Progress metrics were reorganized for clarity.

schedule-data.js was introduced:

A fully embedded JSON object

Automatically used when remote fetch fails

Ensures 100% data availability

This phase made the dashboard feel stable and trustworthy.

Phase 3 — UI Restyle, New Palette & Mini-Runner Game Integration
This is the biggest transformation, shifting the dashboard into a polished, modern product.

Key additions:

1. New Color Token System
A unified theme using:

brand red

gold

plum

These colors flow across:

cards

borders

shadows

text tones

hero gradients

active day pills

mini-runner game assets

This gave the app a consistent identity.

2. Hero Parallax + Banner
The hero section became visually distinct:

fixed 140px header

Siam banner PNG that extends above the header

highest z-index so borders hide behind it

smooth vertical parallax movement

This effect makes the page feel premium without heavy JavaScript.

3. Embedded Mini-Runner Game
Inside the weekly timetable card:

compact canvas

start/play button

collision detection

increasing difficulty

recolored runner + obstacles to match palette

The game sits as an optional “student break” feature and also demonstrates creative UI embedding.

4. Layout Polish
Refinements across the interface include:

softened card shadows

compact search bar

evenly spaced shortcuts

consistent padding

subtle transitions and hover states

This phase represents the dashboard’s transition from functional to aesthetically refined.

5. UI/UX Principles Behind the Current Design
Mobile-first responsiveness
Every element scales naturally down to small screens without breaking.

Legible hierarchy
Cards, headers, and pills follow a predictable structure.

Zero visual clutter
Instead of overloading, sections appear only when needed.

“Calm design” philosophy
Fonts, spacing, shadows, and gradients are all soft and welcoming.

Instant value
Users see:

today’s classes

weekly overview

course list
within seconds of loading the page.

6. Data Handling Strategy
Primary Source
schedule.json fetched via fetch().

Fallback Protection
schedule-data.js contains a complete copy of the schedule.

If fetch fails:

the app logs the error

automatically switches to embedded data

renders everything normally

This ensures high reliability even on unstable networks.

7. Theme System
A full light/dark theme implementation:

Root-level CSS variables

Persistent state via localStorage

Toggle control in hero

All cards and text colors react instantly on toggle

The dark theme is visually dominant but optional.

8. Game Integration Rationale
Why add a game to a student dashboard?

It increases engagement

Shows creative technical ability

Demonstrates canvas animations

Adds personality to the project

Makes the dashboard more memorable for evaluation panels

Can be used as a micro-break tool during study sessions

This is a UI feature, but also a showcase of coding capability.
