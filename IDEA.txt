🔹 What Your App Will Do
Core Features (MVP):
Extract class routine from university’s system.
Pull in old semester grades + course names.
Auto-calculate remaining credits, completed credits, GPA progress.
Show a clean dashboard with upcoming classes and deadlines.
Future Add-Ons:
RFID/Ultrasound attendance system: phones emit/receive sound frequencies for check-in.
3D interactive campus map: helps new students navigate buildings.
AR navigation: scan environment with phone camera → locate position in the 3D map.
Moodle integration: direct assignment submissions, announcements, course materials.


🔹 Tools & Languages You’ll Need
📱 Frontend (App UI):
React Native (best for iOS + Android cross-platform).
Expo (optional, makes testing & deployment easier).
Figma → UI design first, then translate into React Native components.
⚙️ Backend (Data extraction + logic):
Node.js + Express.js (for APIs).
Database: PostgreSQL (structured, good for grades/credits) or MongoDB (flexible).
Web scraping / API integration: If your university doesn’t give APIs, you may need scraping tools like Puppeteer (Node.js) or BeautifulSoup (Python).



🔐 Auth:
University login (OAuth2 / SSO) if available.
Else, basic email/password for MVP.
📡 Future Features (Add-ons):
Ultrasound/RFID attendance → need sound-frequency SDKs (e.g., Google Nearby API, Chirp SDK).
3D campus map → Unity/Three.js model integration inside React Native.
AR navigation → ARCore (Android), ARKit (iOS), integrated via Expo AR modules.
Moodle integration → Use Moodle REST API (already exists).
☁️ Hosting / Deployment:
Backend → Render, Heroku, or AWS.
Database → Supabase (Postgres with auth), Firebase (alt).
App → Play Store + App Store release via Expo EAS.




⚡ My advice for roadmap:
Phase 1: Focus only on routine + grades + credits + clean UI.
Phase 2: Add Moodle integration.
Phase 3: Explore attendance system + 3D/AR features.


==================================================================


For a beginner, a website-first approach is way easier than jumping straight into a mobile app. Since you already have hasanalmaher.com, you can:

Why website first?
Lower barrier → just HTML, CSS, JS (or React if you want interactive parts).

Easier hosting → you already have hosting, no need for app store publishing.

Scraping friendly → you can pull data from the university’s system into your site.

Showcase ready → for your submission, you can say “Prototype website now, app next.”

What you can do right now:
Scrape class routine, grades, credits → display neatly on your site.

Add sections like:

✅ Current Semester Courses

📊 Completed Courses & Credits

📅 Today’s Classes

Wrap it in a clean Figma-style UI (you can even make the site match your Figma design).

Mention in your presentation: “Mobile app version under development” → that’ll impress them.

Later (when you turn it into an app):
You can reuse your website backend → just build a mobile front-end (React Native or Flutter).

All logic/data is already handled → app is mostly UI.

👉 So yes, do the website now as phase 1.
App can be phase 2 in a few months.
